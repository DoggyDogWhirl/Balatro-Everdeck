# Balatro-Everdeck
A (buggy) mod for Balatro that implements the Everdeck, a 120-card deck by efofecks with 8 suits and 15 ranks.

This mod probably needs [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) since I based it off of SixSuits.

1s are called Ones and they don't work in straights :) The 0s probably don't work in straights either
