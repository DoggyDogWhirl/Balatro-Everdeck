# Balatro-Everdeck
A mod for Balatro that implements the Everdeck, a 120-card deck by efofecks with 8 suits and 15 ranks.

This mod probably needs [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) since I based it off of SixSuits.

I don't actually have Balatro yet, so the code is untested. It should still work, though!
